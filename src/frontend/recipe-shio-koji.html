            <h2>Shio Koji (Salt Koji)</h2>
            
            <p>Shio koji is a Japanese fermented seasoning made from rice koji, salt, and water. It's incredibly versatile - use it to marinate fish, chicken, pork, or vegetables. The koji enzymes break down proteins and add umami depth to whatever you're cooking.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Tenderizes meat, adds complex umami flavor, and creates a subtle sweetness. Think of it as a Japanese equivalent to salt - but with way more going on.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:0;"><strong>Time commitment:</strong> 5 minutes to mix, then 2-3 days of hands-off fermentation at room temperature.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Recipe Credit</h3>
            <p>This recipe is from <strong>Sonoko Sakai</strong> and her excellent book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Home-Cooking-Simple-Authentic/dp/1611801842" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rice Craft: Wafu Cooking</a>. If you're interested in Japanese fermentation and rice-based cooking, her book is essential.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            
            <p><strong>For a 20oz batch:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>567g (20oz) freeze-dried rice koji</li>
                <li>200g (~13 tablespoons) sea salt</li>
                <li>800ml (~3⅓ cups) warm water at 80-90°F (26-32°C)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Yield:</strong> About 4-5 cups of shio koji</p>

            <h3>Equipment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Large glass or ceramic bowl</li>
                <li>Clean kitchen towel</li>
                <li>Storage container with lid (glass jar or plastic container)</li>
                <li>Thermometer (optional but helpful)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Where to Buy Koji</h3>
            <p>In Portland, <strong>Uwajimaya</strong> carries freeze-dried rice koji in their refrigerated section. You can also find it at other Asian grocers or order online. Look for packages labeled "rice koji" or "rice malt" - it looks like broken rice grains with white fuzzy mold.</p>

            <h2>The Process</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Mix Koji and Salt</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Break up the koji with your hands - it often clumps together</li>
                <li>Put the koji in a large bowl</li>
                <li>Add the salt</li>
                <li>Mix thoroughly with your hands, breaking up any remaining clumps</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Step 2: Add Warm Water</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat water to 80-90°F (26-32°C) - it should feel warm but not hot to the touch</li>
                <li>Pour the warm water over the koji-salt mixture</li>
                <li>Stir well to combine</li>
                <li>All the koji should be submerged in liquid</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p style="margin:0;"><strong>Water temperature matters:</strong> Too hot (above 100°F) and you'll kill the koji enzymes. Too cold and fermentation will be slower. Aim for bathwater warm - 80-90°F is ideal.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 3: Ferment</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel</li>
                <li>Leave at room temperature (65-75°F) for 2-3 days</li>
                <li>Stir once a day</li>
                <li>It's ready when the koji grains are soft and the mixture smells sweet and slightly funky (in a good way)</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Step 4: Store</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Transfer to a clean container with a lid</li>
                <li>Store in the refrigerator</li>
                <li>Keeps for 6+ months refrigerated</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>How to Use Shio Koji</h2>

            <h3>For Marinades</h3>
            <p>Use about 10% shio koji by weight of whatever you're marinating:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fish:</strong> Marinate for 20-30 minutes (salmon, mackerel, sea bass)</li>
                <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> Marinate for 2-4 hours or overnight (thighs, breasts, whole birds)</li>
                <li><strong>Pork:</strong> Marinate for 2-4 hours or overnight (chops, tenderloin, belly)</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Marinate for 1-2 hours (eggplant, mushrooms, root vegetables)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> For 500g (about 1 lb) of chicken, use about 50g (3-4 tablespoons) of shio koji. Coat the meat, let it sit in the fridge, then cook as normal. You'll get tender, flavorful results.</p>

            <h3>Cooking Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Wipe off excess shio koji before cooking (it can burn)</li>
                <li>The sugars from the koji caramelize beautifully when grilled or pan-fried</li>
                <li>Reduce seasoning in your dish - shio koji is salty</li>
                <li>Works great for yakiniku (grilled meat) or simple pan-seared fish</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Storage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Refrigerator:</strong> 6+ months in a sealed container</li>
                <li><strong>Freezer:</strong> 1+ year (fermentation stops when frozen)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The shio koji will continue to slowly ferment in the fridge, which is fine. It will get a bit funkier over time, but that's normal.</p>

            <h2>Why Make This?</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>It transforms meat and fish.</strong> The enzymes tenderize protein and add incredible depth of flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>It's dead simple.</strong> Three ingredients, minimal effort, and you have a fermented seasoning that lasts months.</li>
                <li><strong>It's versatile.</strong> Use it on anything you'd normally salt - but with way more complexity.</li>
                <li><strong>Store-bought is expensive.</strong> A small jar of prepared shio koji costs $8-12. Making your own costs about $2-3.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Once you have shio koji in your fridge, you'll start using it constantly. Chicken thighs marinated in shio koji and grilled? Unreal. Salmon with shio koji? Perfect every time.</p>

                <p><strong>Recipe Notes:</strong> This recipe is adapted from Sonoko Sakai's <em>Rice Craft: Wafu Cooking</em> and scaled for a 20oz (567g) package of koji. In Portland, buy koji at Uwajimaya or other Asian grocers. Fermentation time depends on room temperature - warmer rooms ferment faster. Last updated: November 2025</p>
