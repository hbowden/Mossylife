            <h2>French-Style Cultured Butter</h2>
            
            <p>This is real butter. Not the bland stuff from the grocery store - cultured butter with actual flavor. It takes time (mostly hands-off), but the difference is massive. If you've ever wondered why butter in France tastes better, this is why.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>What you're making:</strong> Tangy, complex butter with a pale yellow color and smooth texture. This is the butter you spread on good bread and actually taste it.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:0;"><strong>Time commitment:</strong> 5 minutes active work on Day 1, then 20-30 minutes on Day 2. Plus 18-24 hours of waiting while the cream cultures.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>About the Cream</h3>
            <p>The cream matters. You want heavy cream without additives like carrageenan (a thickener/stabilizer). <strong>Alpenrose</strong> is excellent if you're in Portland - clean ingredient list, 40% fat, available at most grocery stores. Other good options: Straus, Organic Valley, or local dairies.</p>

            <p>I've also used <strong>Darigold</strong> (which does contain carrageenan) and it works, but expect lower yield and softer butter. The carrageenan interferes with the churning process.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p style="margin:0;"><strong>💰 Cost Tip:</strong> Restaurant supply stores sell heavy cream by the gallon. <strong>Chef Store</strong> (formerly Cash & Carry) in Portland has gallon jugs of Darigold heavy cream for around $18. From 1 gallon of Darigold, you'll get about 3.5 pounds of butter plus 2-3 quarts of real cultured buttermilk. That's roughly $5/lb for butter that would cost $5+/lb at the store.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            
            <p><strong>For 1 gallon batch:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 gallon (128 oz) heavy cream (preferably 40% fat)</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons cultured buttermilk, crème fraîche, or plain yogurt with live cultures</li>
                <li>1.5-2 teaspoons fine sea salt per pound of butter (or 2-3 tsp flaky sea salt)</li>
                <li>Optional: fresh herbs after churning (thyme, rosemary, chives work well)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Yield from 1 gallon Darigold:</strong> About 3.5 pounds of butter + 2-3 quarts of real cultured buttermilk</p>

            <h3>Equipment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Large bowl or container (at least 1 gallon capacity)</li>
                <li>Stand mixer with whisk attachment (or hand mixer, or shake it in a jar if you're hardcore)</li>
                <li>Cheesecloth or clean kitchen towel</li>
                <li>Spatula</li>
                <li>Ice water</li>
                <li>Kitchen scale (helpful for salting)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Process</h2>

            <h3>Day 1 - Culturing (Morning)</h3>
            
            <p>This is where the flavor happens. You're basically making crème fraîche first, then churning it into butter.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Pour the cream into a large bowl or container</li>
                <li>Stir in 4 tablespoons of cultured buttermilk (or yogurt, or crème fraîche) until mixed</li>
                <li>Cover <em>loosely</em> with cheesecloth or a clean towel - it needs air circulation</li>
                <li>Leave at room temperature (65-72°F) for 18-24 hours</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>What to expect:</strong> The cream will thicken noticeably and develop a tangy, slightly sour smell. Taste it - it should be pleasantly sour, like crème fraîche. Not spoiled-milk sour, but tangy and complex.</p>

            <p><strong>Longer = tangier.</strong> French butter is quite tangy, so I usually go toward 24 hours. If you want milder butter, stop at 18 hours.</p>

            <h3>Day 2 - Chilling (Morning)</h3>
            
            <p>You need the cultured cream cold but not ice-cold before churning.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Cover the cultured cream and refrigerate for 2-4 hours</li>
                <li>Target temperature: 50-60°F (cold but not ice-cold)</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p style="margin:0;"><strong>Temperature matters:</strong> Too cold and it takes forever to churn. Too warm and you get soft, greasy butter. You want it cold enough that it feels refreshing but not so cold it hurts your hand.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Churning</h3>
            
            <p>This is the fun part. You're about to turn liquid cream into solid butter.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Pour the chilled cultured cream into your stand mixer bowl</li>
                <li>Use the whisk attachment, start on low-medium speed (speed 4-6 on KitchenAid)</li>
                <li>Watch the progression:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Liquid → thickens → whipped cream peaks → grainy → <strong>suddenly breaks</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>When it breaks (usually 5-15 minutes), butter clumps together and buttermilk separates</li>
                <li>Stop immediately - don't over-churn</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>The "break"</strong> is obvious - one moment you have thick grainy cream, the next moment you have yellow butter clumps floating in milky liquid. Can't miss it.</p>

            <h3>Washing (CRITICAL)</h3>
            
            <p>This step is what makes it French butter. American butter is barely washed. French butter is thoroughly washed. It's the difference between butter that goes rancid in a week and butter that stays fresh for weeks.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Drain the buttermilk into a container - <strong>SAVE THIS!</strong> (more on that below)</li>
                <li>Add ice-cold water to cover the butter</li>
                <li>Use a spatula to press and knead the butter against the bowl for 30 seconds</li>
                <li>The water will turn cloudy/milky - pour it off</li>
                <li>Repeat 4-6 times until the water runs <strong>completely clear</strong></li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Why wash?</strong> You're removing trapped buttermilk. Any buttermilk left in the butter will spoil quickly and give it an off flavor. Clear water = properly washed butter = longer shelf life.</p>

            <h3>Working the Butter</h3>
            
            <p>Now you're getting rid of trapped water and making the texture uniform.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Press the butter firmly with a spatula to expel trapped water</li>
                <li>Fold and press repeatedly for 2-3 minutes</li>
                <li>The butter should feel smooth and uniform, with no water pockets</li>
                <li>Pour off any released liquid</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Salting</h3>
            
            <p>French butter is often lightly salted or unsalted. I prefer lightly salted for everyday use.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Weigh your butter</li>
                <li>Add salt at 1-1.5% by weight:
                    <ul>
                        <li>For 3.5 pounds butter: 1.5-2 teaspoons fine sea salt</li>
                        <li>Or 2-3 teaspoons flaky sea salt (Maldon, Jacobsen)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Work the salt in thoroughly with your spatula</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust if needed</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Flaky vs. fine salt:</strong> Flaky salt (Maldon, Jacobsen) gives you little bursts of salt, which is nice on bread. Fine sea salt distributes more evenly. Both work.</p>

            <h3>Shaping</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Pack the butter into a mold or parchment-lined container</li>
                <li>Press firmly to eliminate air pockets</li>
                <li>Smooth the top with a spatula</li>
                <li>Cover and refrigerate</li>
            </ol>

            <p>You can also form it into logs wrapped in parchment paper, or press it into ramekins, or whatever. I usually just pack it into a rectangular container.</p>

            <h2>Storage</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Refrigerator:</strong> 2-3 weeks (if washed properly)</li>
                <li><strong>Freezer:</strong> 6+ months (wrap well)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The thorough washing is what gives you the long fridge life. Poorly washed butter goes bad in less than a week.</p>

            <h3>The Cultured Buttermilk</h3>
            
            <p>Don't throw this away. This is <strong>real buttermilk</strong> - not the cultured skim milk they sell in stores. This is the liquid left over from churning cultured cream, and it's fantastic.</p>

            <p><strong>Use it for:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Biscuits (the best you'll ever make)</li>
                <li>Pancakes and waffles</li>
                <li>Fried chicken brine</li>
                <li>Ranch dressing</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Storage:</strong> Use within 1 week, refrigerated. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for later use.</p>

            <h2>Why Bother?</h2>
            
            <p>Fair question. Store butter is $4-6/lb. This takes effort. But:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>It tastes better.</strong> Dramatically better. Complex, tangy, actually has flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>It's cheaper</strong> if you buy cream in bulk. About $5/lb vs $8-12/lb for good cultured butter.</li>
                <li><strong>You get real buttermilk</strong> as a bonus product.</li>
                <li><strong>You can customize it</strong> - add herbs, adjust salt levels, control the tanginess.</li>
                <li><strong>It's satisfying</strong> to make something this good from scratch.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Once you taste real cultured butter, store butter tastes like nothing. That's the problem with making this - you can't go back.</p>
