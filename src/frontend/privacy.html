                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Mossy Life ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you visit mossylife.com (the "Site").</p>

                <p>By using our Site, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

                <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
                <p>Currently, we do not collect personal information that you directly provide (such as through contact forms or account registration), as we do not have these features implemented. If we add these features in the future, we will update this policy accordingly.</p>

                <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
                <p>When you visit our Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device and your visit, including:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Your Internet Protocol address</li>
                    <li><strong>Browser Information:</strong> Your web browser type and version (user agent string)</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Type of device (desktop, mobile, tablet)</li>
                    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Approximate geographic location (country-level)</li>

                    <li><strong>Click Data:</strong> Links clicked, including affiliate links</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cookies and Tracking</h3>
                <p>We do not currently use cookies on our Site. Our analytics are performed server-side without placing any tracking files on your device.</p>

                <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> To understand how visitors use our Site and improve user experience</li>
                    <li><strong>Content Optimization:</strong> To determine which content is most valuable to our readers</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Analytics</h2>
                <p>We use a custom-built analytics system that collects visitor information directly to our database. This system:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Stores IP addresses and user agent strings for up to 1 year</li>
                    <li>Tracks unique visitors using a daily-rotating hash of your IP and user agent</li>
                    <li>Records page views, referrers, and link clicks</li>
                    <li>Does not share data with third-party analytics services</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Most analytics data is automatically deleted after 1 year. Some aggregated statistics may be retained longer.</p>

                <h2>Affiliate Links and Advertising</h2>

                <h3>Tracking Affiliate Clicks</h3>

                    <li>The timestamp of the click</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This information helps us understand which products and content are most helpful to our readers and is used for commission tracking purposes.</p>

                <h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
                <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>

                    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, court order, or government request.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If Mossy Life is acquired or merged with another entity, user information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
                </ul>
