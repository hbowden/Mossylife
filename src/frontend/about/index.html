                <h2>Hey, I'm Harrison</h2>
                
                <p>Welcome to Mossy Life! I'm a software engineer living in Portland, Oregon, and this is where I write about the things that make life here interesting.</p>

                <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>
                
                <p>This blog is my personal documentation project - honest reviews, growing experiments, weather observations, recipes, and the occasional tech deep-dive. If it's something I'm curious about or experimenting with, it ends up here.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>🌲 The Mossy Life Philosophy:</strong> The Pacific Northwest gives us an incredible opportunity - we can grow almost anything here, power it with clean energy, track it with technology, and cook it into something delicious. That intersection of nature, tech, and food is what this blog is all about.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>My Obsessions</h3>

                <p><strong>Weather & Climate:</strong> I run a Tempest weather station in my backyard and monitor greenhouse conditions with SensorPush sensors. There's something deeply satisfying about having real-time data on what's happening right outside your door. Portland weather is endlessly fascinating - the microclimates, the rain patterns, the perfect growing conditions.</p>

                <p><strong>Growing Things:</strong> From a hydroponic citrus setup to greenhouse experiments, I'm constantly trying to push what's possible in Portland's climate. My dream? Cook a completely Oregon-sourced meal - local flour, homemade salt, garden vegetables, foraged ingredients. We're getting close.</p>

                <p><strong>Food & Cooking:</strong> Japanese food especially, but really anything that challenges me in the kitchen. Cooking is where science meets creativity, and I love documenting what works (and what doesn't).</p>

                <p><strong>Tech That Actually Works:</strong> As a software engineer, I appreciate technology that solves real problems. Whether it's fiber internet that doesn't drop during work calls, smart sensors that help plants thrive, or tools that make life easier - if I use it and trust it, I'll write about it.</p>

                <h3>Beyond the Blog</h3>

                <p>When I'm not coding, growing, or cooking, you'll find me:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Snowboarding on Mt. Hood</li>
                    <li>Hiking PNW trails</li>
                    <li>Reading about history or following space technology news (SpaceX launches are my Super Bowl)</li>
                    <li>Exploring the clean energy transition</li>
                    <li>Hanging out with friends and my amazing girlfriend</li>
                    <li>Planning the next trip or the next meal</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why "Mossy Life"?</h3>

                <p>Living in the Pacific Northwest means embracing the moss, the rain, the forests, and the unique growing conditions. It's about making the most of where we are - using technology to enhance our connection to nature, not replace it. Growing food with sensors. Tracking weather patterns. Cooking with local ingredients. It's all connected.</p>

                <h3>What I Write About</h3>

                <p><strong>Tech Reviews:</strong> Honest assessments of products I actually use. No fluff, no sponsored nonsense - just real experience with tools that work in the PNW lifestyle.</p>

                <p><strong>Growing & Hydroponics:</strong> Experiments with indoor growing, greenhouse climate control, and pushing the boundaries of what we can cultivate in Portland.</p>

                <p><strong>Weather & Data:</strong> Observations from my backyard weather station, seasonal patterns, and how local weather affects growing and living here.</p>

                <p><strong>Recipes & Cooking:</strong> Techniques, experiments, and dishes that work - especially Japanese cuisine and Oregon-sourced meals.</p>

                <h3>My Approach</h3>

                <p>Everything on this blog is something I genuinely use, grow, cook, or care about. I don't write about products I haven't tried or techniques I haven't tested. If there's an affiliate link, it's because I'd recommend it to a friend anyway.</p>

                <p>I'm not trying to be an influencer or build an empire - this is just documentation of life in Portland, done the way I want to live it: curious, sustainable, tech-enabled, and delicious.</p>
