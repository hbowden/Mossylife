            <h2>Flaky Pie Crust (Lard + Butter)</h2>
            
            <p>This is a simple pie dough recipe that I use in my other recipes. The combination of lard and butter gives you the flakiness of lard with the flavor of butter. It's not fancy, but it's reliable.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p style="margin:0;"><strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> This recipe makes ONE crust (bottom or top). For a full pie with top and bottom crusts, double everything.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Why Lard + Butter?</h3>
            <p><strong>Lard</strong> creates the flakiest crust because it has larger fat crystals than butter. <strong>Butter</strong> tastes better. Using both gets you flaky and flavorful.</p>

            <p>I use half the lard amount from traditional recipes and substitute butter for the rest. This gives you most of the flakiness without the all-lard flavor (which some people don't like).</p>

            <h3>Ingredients (Single Crust)</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>187g all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>Pinch of salt</li>
                <li>55g cold lard</li>
                <li>55g cold butter - use <a href="/recipe-cultured-butter.html">homemade cultured butter</a> if you have it</li>
                <li>45ml (3 tablespoons) ice-cold water (more if needed)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>For a full pie (top + bottom):</strong> Double everything.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>About the fats:</strong> Use leaf lard if possible (it's the highest quality, cleanest-tasting lard from around the kidneys). Regular lard works too. For butter, <a href="/recipe-cultured-butter.html">homemade cultured butter</a> adds extra flavor, but store-bought works fine.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Equipment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Large bowl</li>
                <li>Pastry cutter or two knives (or your hands)</li>
                <li>Plastic wrap or parchment paper</li>
                <li>Rolling pin</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Process</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Keep Everything Cold</h3>
            <p>This is the most important rule. Cold fat = flaky crust. Warm fat = tough, greasy crust.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Cut your butter and lard into small cubes</li>
                <li>Put them back in the fridge or freezer while you measure flour</li>
                <li>Use ice water (literally put ice cubes in the water)</li>
                <li>If your kitchen is hot, chill the flour too</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Put flour and salt in a large bowl</li>
                <li>Whisk to combine</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Step 3: Cut in the Fats</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add cold lard and butter cubes to the flour</li>
                <li>Use a pastry cutter (or two knives, or your hands) to cut the fat into the flour</li>
                <li>Work quickly - you don't want the fat to warm up</li>
                <li>Stop when the mixture looks like coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces of fat</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>What you're looking for:</strong> The fat should be in small pieces, coated with flour. Some pieces will be tiny, some will be pea-sized. That's good - those visible fat chunks create flakiness.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p style="margin:0;"><strong>Don't overwork it:</strong> If you mix too much, the fat warms up and gets incorporated into the flour instead of staying in distinct pieces. That makes a tough crust instead of a flaky one.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 4: Add Water</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Drizzle 45ml (3 tablespoons) of ice-cold water over the mixture</li>
                <li>Use a fork to mix it in</li>
                <li>The dough should start coming together but still look shaggy</li>
                <li>If it's too dry to hold together, add more water 5ml (1 teaspoon) at a time</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>How much water?</strong> Depends on humidity, flour type, how you measured. Start with 45ml. Add more if needed. The dough should hold together when you squeeze it, but shouldn't be wet or sticky.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Form and Chill</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Dump the shaggy dough onto a work surface</li>
                <li>Use your hands to gather it into a ball</li>
                <li>Flatten into a disk about 1 inch thick</li>
                <li>Wrap in plastic wrap or parchment paper</li>
                <li>Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 days)</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Why chill?</strong> This lets the flour hydrate fully and firms up the fat again. Chilled dough is also easier to roll out.</p>

            <h3>Step 6: Roll Out</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Take the dough out of the fridge</li>
                <li>If it's rock-hard, let it sit for 5-10 minutes until slightly softened</li>
                <li>Flour your work surface and rolling pin</li>
                <li>Roll from the center outward, rotating the dough as you go</li>
                <li>Roll to about ⅛ inch thick</li>
                <li>It should be about 2 inches larger than your pie pan</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>If the dough cracks:</strong> It's too cold. Let it warm up a few more minutes. If it gets sticky or greasy, it's too warm - put it back in the fridge for 10 minutes.</p>

            <h3>Step 7: Transfer to Pan</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Roll the dough loosely around your rolling pin</li>
                <li>Unroll it over your pie pan</li>
                <li>Gently press into the bottom and sides</li>
                <li>Trim edges, leaving about 1 inch overhang</li>
                <li>Fold the overhang under and crimp the edges</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>For a Blind-Baked Crust</h2>
            <p>If your recipe calls for a pre-baked crust (like for cream pies or custard pies):</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Prick the bottom of the crust all over with a fork</li>
                <li>Line with parchment paper and fill with pie weights (or dried beans)</li>
                <li>Bake at 375°F for 15 minutes</li>
                <li>Remove weights and parchment</li>
                <li>Bake another 10-15 minutes until golden brown</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Storage</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unbaked dough:</strong> Refrigerate up to 2 days, or freeze up to 3 months (wrap well)</li>
                <li><strong>Rolled-out crust:</strong> Freeze in the pie pan, wrapped well, up to 1 month</li>
                <li><strong>Baked crust:</strong> Room temperature for 1 day, or freeze up to 1 month</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

            <h3>The crust shrinks when baking</h3>
            <p>You overworked the dough (developed too much gluten). Next time, handle it less and make sure it's well-chilled before baking.</p>

            <h3>The crust is tough or chewy</h3>
            <p>Either too much water, too much mixing, or the fat got too warm. Keep everything cold and handle the dough as little as possible.</p>

            <h3>The crust isn't flaky</h3>
            <p>The fat pieces got too small. You want visible chunks of fat in the dough - they melt during baking and create the flaky layers.</p>

            <h3>The bottom is soggy</h3>
            <p>Blind-bake the crust before adding wet fillings. Or brush the unbaked crust with egg white before filling - it creates a moisture barrier.</p>

            <h2>Why This Ratio?</h2>
            
            <p>Traditional pie crusts use all butter (tasty but not super flaky) or all lard (very flaky but some people don't like the flavor). This 50/50 split gives you:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flakiness from the lard</strong> - creates those distinct, crispy layers</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor from the butter</strong> - especially good if you use <a href="/recipe-cultured-butter.html">cultured butter</a></li>
                <li><strong>Easy to work with</strong> - lard makes the dough more forgiving than all-butter</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can adjust the ratio based on preference. More lard = flakier but less buttery. More butter = more flavor but slightly less flaky.</p>

            <h2>Remember: Double for a Full Pie</h2>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p style="margin:0;"><strong>This recipe makes ONE crust.</strong> If you're making a pie with both a bottom and top crust (like apple pie), you need to double all the ingredients. Make two separate dough disks - it's easier than trying to divide one large batch.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cta-box">
                <p style="margin-bottom:0;"><strong>Made this recipe?</strong> Let me know what you used it for. I'm always curious what pies people are making.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="background: var(--bg-light); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin-top: 3rem; font-size: 0.9375rem;">
                <p style="margin-bottom:0;"><strong>Recipe Notes:</strong> This recipe uses a 50/50 lard-butter combination (55g each). If you can't find lard or prefer all-butter crust, just use 110g cold butter instead. It will be slightly less flaky but still good. Last updated: November 2025</p>
